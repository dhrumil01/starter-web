# Important

Because the other README.md is already available in this repo, but the GitHub Ultimate Course tells me to add a README.md into it. So I just yolo'd this plsREADME.md file into that repo :p :*

Be healthy and careful in this times!
Have a nice day, friends!

## Purpose of this readme

Actually I wanted to add a README.md, as in the "Git Ultimate" Udemy course instructed.
But unfortunately in the main Repo is already a README.md file, which gave me no other choice, than creating this one, which I called plsREADME.md.
