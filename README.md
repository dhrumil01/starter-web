## Introduction
What does Git do?
Manage projects with Repositories
Clone a project to work on a local copy
Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
Push local updates to the main project ok as well
## Purpose
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
You select the modified files you want to Stage
The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
You can revert back to any previous commit.

## Deployment
Over 70% of developers use Git!
Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
Developers can see the full history of the project.
Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.

## How to contribute
Git is not the same as GitHub.
GitHub makes tools that use Git.
GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
