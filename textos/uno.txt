Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. When they come... they come at what you love. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.
