There is another thing  that is attached to Rabbit which  and which is very important and another temporary Unit called queue manager that still exist few years after it was created but will be replaced after the upgrade of criterium… and what this it does is priority (task priority) because  we want to have control over the task ..for example when a customer upload their files through web dev monitor, where web dev push the files to criterium and criterium pushes it to Rabbit.. and lets say  customer A uploads 800 flights flies and there are on the queue but before the new 100 flight files is being uploaded ..and a customer has previously asked the dev team to process 100,000 with a change in the logic, so the dev team have processed 100,000 before the Customer A uploaded its flight files and what Queue does is from dev team processing which is processing before customer A uploaded the new flight , so we would have actual needs to wait for  the Rabbit to finish processing the 100,000 flight but because our daily capacity to process flight is about 50 – 60 thousand flights, we would need to have wait for 2 days before we can process the new uploaded flights from customer A  and the company can’t afford it. So queue manager is set to manage the priorities and in that way we process does flights quickly…
