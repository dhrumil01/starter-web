A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy. … or cocaine. Annhog's coming? So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Everybody dance NOW.

There are dozens of us! DOZENS! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone.

He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC?

I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. That coat costs more than your house! We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'.

The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!)
