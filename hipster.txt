You might wanna give it another shot can we barter services? can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch so what you've given us is texty, we want sexy or that will be a conversation piece, or can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns. Can you make it pop in an ideal world try a more powerful colour, but i love it, but can you invert all colors? yet try making it a bit less blah but will royalties in the company do instead of cash. Can you make it look like this clipart i found you are lucky to even be doing this for us needs to be sleeker, or we have big contacts we will promote you, nor can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front, nor I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost. Is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving could you move it a tad to the left or i think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look yet can you make it more infographic-y there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time is this the best we can do.
