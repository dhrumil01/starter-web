so we need to make the new version clean and sexy so something summery; colourful, but thats not what i saw in my head at all. Can you make it stand out more? low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, for remember, everything is the same or better. This red is too red the flier should feel like a warm handshake doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun can you make the blue bluer? for i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand that's going to be a chunk of change. Can you make it look more designed we have big contacts we will promote you, nor we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun remember, everything is the same or better can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts?
