According to a Rolling Stone report, after announcing that he was working on his third album, Avicii was at his LA home studio with songwriter/producer, Joe Janiak where they worked together before he traveled to Oman to visit his royal friends.

After his death, Janiak confirmed that Avicii didn’t look like someone who was at the end of his days, and was rather “pumped” about life, and had said he would reach out again after he was back from his trip.





It was nearly impossible for them to reach him fast enough before he took his own life. It was rumored that his brother, David, had traveled to Oman to be with his brother. He however couldn’t make it quickly enough as Avicii had taken his own life about two hours before his brother arrived.
