Le Guin published a variety of work in the second half of the 1970s. This included speculative fiction in the form of the novel The Eye of the Heron, which, according to Le Guin, may be a part of the Hainish universe.[40][69][70] She also published Very Far Away from Anywhere Else, a realistic novel for adolescents,[71] as well as the collection Orsinian Tales and the novel Malafrena in 1976 and 1979, respectively. Though the latter two were set in the fictional country of Orsinia, the stories were realistic fiction rather than fantasy or science fiction.[72] The Language of the Night, a collection of essays, was released in 1979,[73] and Le Guin also published Wild Angels, a volume of poetry, in 1975.[74]

Between 1979, when she published Malafrena, and 1994, when the collection A Fisherman of the Inland Sea was released, Le Guin wrote primarily for a younger audience.[75] In 1985 she published the experimental work Always Coming Home.[76] She wrote 11 children's picture books, including the Catwings series, between 1979 and 1994, along with The Beginning Place, an adolescent fantasy novel, released in 1980.[34][75][77] Four more poetry collections were also published in this period, all of which were positively received.[74][75] She also revisited Earthsea, publishing Tehanu in 1992: coming eighteen years after The Farthest Shore, during which Le Guin's views had developed considerably, the book was grimmer in tone than the earlier works in the series, and challenged some ideas presented therein. It received critical praise,[78] and led to the series being recognized among adult literature
