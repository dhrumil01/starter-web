If you want to merge your branch to master on remote, follow the below steps:

    push your branch say 'br-1' to remote using git push origin br-1.
    switch to master branch on your local repository using git checkout master.
    update local master with remote master using git pull origin master.
    merge br-1 into local master using git merge br-1. This may give you conflicts which need to be resolved and changes committed before moving further.
    Once merge of br-1 to master on local is committed, push local master to remote master using git push origin master.
